# Microprocessor-Based-Virtual-Pet
Final project showcasing skills learned from Advanced Microprocessors course.

## Abstract
The purpose of this final project is to complete a larger project that showcases skills learned in the Advanced Microprocessors course including the use of an RTOS.
The concept for this project is for you to create a virtual pet. My inspiration for this project was
the Tamagotchi! (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi) from the late 90s. If you are not
familiar with virtual pets, please see the Wikipedia page and search online. You can find
youtube videos, as well. Several other virtual pets (aka pocket pets) have developed through
the years. You may choose exactly how you want to create your pet.

## Requirements
Please make sure that the lifecycle works on a time schedule so that you can demo it to me
within 10 minutes. To receive an 85% grade, you must complete the following project
requirements:
1. Use the TI-RTOS with the MSP432 launchpad and EDUMKII booster pack.
2. When you begin the program, display your logo on the LCD panel of the EDUMKII
booster pack for at least 5 seconds. This image should be displayed anytime the
program is started or a reset button is pressed and released.
3. Use the buzzer
4. Use the joystick
5. Use the temperature sensor
6. Use both pushbuttons
7. Use the accelerometer
