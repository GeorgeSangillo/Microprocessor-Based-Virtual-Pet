 *  @brief      ADC driver implementation for the ADC peripheral on MSP432
 *
 *  This ADC driver implementation is designed to operate on a ADC14 peripheral
 *  for MSP432.  The ADC MSP432 header file should be included in an application
 *  as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/ADC.h>
 *  #include <ti/drivers/ADCMSP432.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Refer to @ref ADC.h for a complete description of APIs & example of use.
